My name is Zack. I'm a (relatively new) Angeleno, and New York sports fan (go Yankees). I've worked at large companies, startups, and in politics. I've built teams, acted as a firefighter, worked at scale maintaining streaming infrastructure, and built several teams. I'm an experienced frontend engineer, SRE, AWS administrator, and engineering leader (both technical and man management), but my personal passion is observability and using it to drive engineering decisions.
